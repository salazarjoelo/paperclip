/**
 * The fixed observability surface for the sandbox duplex transport.
 *
 * This module owns the one closed contract for every duplex telemetry sink: the
 * span names, the counter names, the one event name, the dimension keys, and the
 * enum values. Each name and value is a literal constant here, so the surface
 * never drifts and a test asserts the exact set.
 *
 * The module also owns the provider allowlist. The `provider` dimension carries
 * one approved public value, `daytona`. Any other plugin key maps to the constant
 * `other`. The map runs inside this module before every sink, so a raw plugin key
 * never reaches a span attribute, a counter label, or an event field.
 *
 * The module stays free of `@opentelemetry/api` and of the database. The host
 * injects a {@link DuplexTelemetryRecorder}; the default is a no-op recorder, so
 * the whole surface stays inert until the host binds a real recorder. Every
 * recorder call sits inside an error swallow, so a telemetry failure never breaks
 * the request path.
